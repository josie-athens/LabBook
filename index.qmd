# Welcome {.unnumbered}

My dad once dropped some wisdom on me about leaving a legacy. He said there were three key things I should do:

1. Plant a seed and watch it grow into a beautiful tree.
2. Get creative and do something awesome, like writing a book (or anything else you're passionate about).
3. Have some kiddos of your own.

When I was a wee little one, I planted a peach seed. Believe it or not, that peach tree is still standing strong in my parents' backyard.

Oh, and guess what? I ended up having two amazing kids of my own!

And as for the book, this one ticks off that second point on my dad's legacy list.

Hope you enjoy hearing my story!
