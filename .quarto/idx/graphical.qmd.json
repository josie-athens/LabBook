Once you have mastered the basic principles covered in this laboratory, you should be well prepared to construct basic graphs.\n\nThis lab has several optional sections, you are welcome to do to those sections or simply use them as a reference for making plots.\n\nOnce you have completed this lab, you should feel comfortable:\n\n-   Constructing histograms and density plots.\n-   Constructing scatter plots (both bivariate and matrix) and line charts.\n-   Constructing box plots.\n-   Constructing QQ-plots.\n-   Constructing strip charts.\n-   Constructing bar charts.\n-   Adding titles and labels to these graphs.\n-   Customising these graphs by setting appropriate options.\n-   Exporting plots for publications or other purposes.\n\n> **Summary of New Commands**\n\n| **Command**            | **Library**   | **Function**                                            |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **autoplot**           | *ggplot2*     | Plots objects from different classes                    |\n| **axis_labs**          | *pubh*        | Uses labels from labelled data for axis legends         |\n| **bar_error**          | *pubh*        | Constructs bar charts with error bars                   |\n| **box_plot**           | *pubh*        | Constructs box-plots                                    |\n| **correlation**        | *correlation* | Estimates correlation coefficients                      |\n| **dev.off**            | *grDevices*   | Closes the current graphing device                      |\n| **get_label**          | *sjlabelled*  | Retrieves variable label                                |\n| **gf_counts**          | *ggformula*   | Constructs bar plots (using counts)                     |\n| **gf_dens**            | *ggformula*   | Constructs density plots (contour)                      |\n| **gf_density**         | *ggformula*   | Constructs density plots (filled)                       |\n| **gf_dhistogram**      | *ggformula*   | Constructs histograms in terms of density               |\n| **gf_histogram**       | *ggformula*   | Constructs histograms in terms of frequency             |\n| **gf_jitter**          | *ggformula*   | Constructs strip charts                                 |\n| **gf_line**            | *ggformula*   | Constructs line charts                                  |\n| **gf_labs**            | *ggformula*   | Edits plot's labels (axis, mains, facets)               |\n| **gf_lm**              | *ggformula*   | Fits a simple linear model to a scatter plot            |\n| **gf_point**           | *ggformula*   | Constructs scatter plots                                |\n| **gf_refine**          | *ggformula*   | Used to change scales and theme in a plot               |\n| **gf_smooth**          | *ggformula*   | Adds a loess fit (trend) to a scatter plot              |\n| **gf_star**            | *pubh*        | Adds a significant line for annotating plots            |\n| **gf_summary**         | *ggformula*   | Aggregates data by statistics to add to a plot          |\n| **gf_theme**           | *ggformula*   | Changes aspects of the theme                            |\n| **gf_violin**          | *ggformula*   | Constructs violin plots                                 |\n| **ggpairs**            | *GGally*      | Constructs scatter plot matrices                        |\n| **his_norm**           | *pubh*        | Constructs histograms with normal curve                 |\n| **na.omit**            | *stats*       | Removes observations with missing values from a dataset |\n| **pdf**                | *grDevices*   | Exports figures as PDF                                  |\n| **pivot_longer**       | *dplyr*       | Transforms data from wide to long format                |\n| **plot_scatter**       | *sjPlot*      | Constructs scatter plots                                |\n| **postscript**         | *grDevices*   | Exports figures as EPS files                            |\n| **qq_plot**            | *pubh*        | Constructs QQ-plots                                     |\n| **remove_all_labels**  | *sjlabelled*  | Removes labels from a dataset                           |\n| **sjplot**             | *sjPlot*      | Constructs plots using pipe-workflow                    |\n| **stat_compare_means** | *ggpubr*      | Adds a significant line for annotating plots            |\n| **strip_error**        | *pubh*        | Constructs strip plots with error bars                  |\n\n## Introduction\n\nChapter 4 of [@iswr] shows how to do basic descriptive statistics, as well as the classic plots in `R`. There are more graphic packages that allow better graphics, one of them is `ggplot2` whose syntax is relatively complex. We will be using the package `ggformula` which simplifies syntax for constructing plots with `ggplot2` using formulas as part of its syntax. The package is loaded in the system when you load the `pubh` package.\n\nThere are different reasons to make a plot. For manuscripts and reports, plots in black and white (B&W) are sometimes preferred (as figures in colour have an extra cost). However, if you want to show your plots in a presentation or a poster, a colour would be more appropriate.\n\n**For manuscripts**\n\n1.  Include figure legends (captions).\n2.  The *main* title is not included in the plot but as part of the description in the legend.\n3.  Use B&W plots, you can use any variation of grey.\n4.  Export the plot as a `.eps` or `.pdf` file (see last section).\n\n**For reports, including assignments**\n\n1.  Include figure legends (captions).\n2.  The *main* title is not included in the plot but as part of the description in the legend.\n3.  You can play with colours, but be smart, e.g., avoid bright colours.\n\n**For presentations**\n\n1.  Do not include long legends.\n2.  Use a medium to large font so audience can read your legends.\n3.  Include a main title for the plot.\n4.  Use colours!\n5.  Include extra information to explain the plot, or make sure that you explain well your plot in your presentation.\n6.  Export the plot as a `.pdf` or `.png` file (see last section).\n\nWe will use the `wcgs` dataset as an example of a relatively large data, the `kfm` dataset as an example of a relatively small data and the `birthwt` as an example of medium size data.\n\nFirst we load datasets that we have saved in previous labs:\n\n```{r}\nwcgs = read_rds('data/wcgs.rds')\nkfm = read_rds('data/kfm.rds')\n```\n\nNext, we load the `birthwt` dataset from the `MASS` package, generate factors and assign labels.\n\n```{r}\ndata(birthwt, package = \"MASS\")\nbirthwt = as_tibble(birthwt)\nbirthwt = birthwt %>%\n  mutate(\n    low = factor(low, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n    lwt = lwt * 0.4536,\n    smoke = factor(smoke, labels = c(\"Non-smoker\", \"Smoker\")),\n    Race = factor(race > 1, labels = c(\"White\", \"Non-white\")),\n    race = factor(race, labels = c(\"White\", \"African-American\", \"Other\")),\n    ht = factor(ht, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n    ui = factor(ui, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n  ) %>%\n  var_labels(\n    low = \"Birth weight less than 2.5 kg\",\n    age = \"Mother's age (years)\",\n    lwt = \"Mother's weight (kg)\",\n    bwt = 'Birth weight (g)',\n    smoke = 'Smoking status',\n    race = \"Mother's race\",\n    ptl = \"Premature labours\",\n    ht = \"Hypertension\",\n    ui = \"Uterine irritability\",\n  )\n```\n\n```{r}\nwrite_rds(birthwt, \"data/birthwt.rds\")\n```\n\n### Extensions and links\n\nFor this lab, we are going to load some packages that extend functions from `ggplot2`.\n\n-   Functions in `ggsci` are really optional as they provide palettes used in journals.\n-   Functions in `GGaly` are just for special cases, like scatter plot matrices.\n-   Functions in `ggpubr` are intended for publication purposes.\n-   Functions in `plotly` allow to interact with the plots.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n**External links**\n\n- More information on `ggformula`, including tutorials, can be found [here](https://projectmosaic.github.io/ggformula/index.html).\n- Examples for `ggpubr` can be found [here](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/).\n- Examples for `GGally` can be found [here](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/index.html).\n- Examples about axis scales and transformations can be found [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-axis-scales-and-transformations).\n:::\n\n## Distributions\n\nAs part of the descriptive analysis, it is important to understand the distribution of continuous outcomes. For relatively large datasets, histograms and density plots are appropriate.\n\n### Histograms\n\nWe use histograms to look at the distribution of continuous variables. Histograms make most sense for relatively large data ($\\geq$ 100 observations). The `ggformula` package uses *formulas*; in the case of histograms, there is no left-hand side (as it was the case of `estat`). For example, for plotting the histogram of systolic blood pressure we type:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig1\n#| fig-cap: \"Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_histogram( ~ sbp, col = \"black\", fill = \"pink\")\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nThe bars are not at the centre of the plot, that means we have cases (very few of them) with high values of cholesterol. In other words, the distribution is clearly skewed to the right (i.e., with a positive skew).\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  At the start of the code, the first two lines (hidden on the final document) are:\n  - `#| label: fig-fig1`\n  - `#| fig-cap: \"Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.\"`\n2.  The label (name) of the chunk is: `fig-fig1`. When the label starts with `fig-`, the figure is automatically numbered. To refer to @fig-fig1 in the document we type: `@fig-fig1`.\n3.  The option `col` refers to the colour of the lines defining the bars; the option `fill` refers to the colour inside the bars.\n4.  You can look at the list of colours available by typing `colors()` in the *Console* panel.\n:::\n\nIn our first plot, the $y$-axis shows the frequency (counts), we may want to show the density (proportion) instead. Densities are preferred when comparing two or more distributions. To choose density we use `gf_dhistogram`:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig2\n#| fig-cap: \"Histograms of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_dhistogram(~ sbp, col = \"black\", fill = \"plum3\")\n```\n\nWe can compare groups using the `|` symbol, which can be understood as *given* or *by*:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig3\n#| fig-cap: \"Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by coronary heart disease (CHD) event for the WCGS dataset.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_dhistogram(~ sbp|chd, col = \"black\", fill = \"slategray3\")\n```\n\n### Density plots\n\nAn alternative to histograms is density plots.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig4\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of birth weight.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_dens(~ bwt, col = \"cadetblue\", lwd = 1)\n```\n\nWe can use superimposed density plots to compare distributions.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig5\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of birth weight distributions by mother's smoking status.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt, fill = ~ smoke, alpha = 0.3)\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  In the previous code, instead of displaying the distributions in two different panels (*faceting*) as we did with histograms, we are displaying them in the same panel but super-imposed.\n2.  By using the option `fill = ~ smoke`, we are telling `R` to select filling colours according to levels in the variable `smoke`.\n3.  With `alpha` we reduce the opacity, thus increase the transparency.\n4.  With `gf_dens` we plot only the contour whereas with `gf_density` the area under the curve is filled.\n:::\n\nIf you use the template from the `pubh` package, legends are placed on *top* of the plot. To specify a different location, we can use the argument `legend.position` in `gf_theme`. With `legend.position` we can either specify a side of the plot (e.g. `\"right\"`) or give relative coordinates. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig6\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of birth weight distributions by smoking status of the mother and race of the mother.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt|smoke, fill = ~ race, alpha=0.3) %>%\n  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.12, 0.85))\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nCoordinates are given as `c(x, y)`, where values of `x` and `y` go from 0 to 1 and represent a proportion in the corresponding axis.\n:::\n\nTo help on the interpretation of histograms, we can impose a *density* plot derived from a population with the same mean and standard deviation of the variable of interest. To make this plot, we can use the function `hist_norm` from the `pubh` package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig7\n#| fig-cap: \"Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset. The black curve represents a density plot from a normal distribution.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  hist_norm(~ sbp, bins = 30) \n```\n\n### QQ-plots\n\nThe best way to determine if a continuous variable is normally distributed or not is with quantile-quantile plots (QQ-plots). We plot the quantiles of our variable of interest against quantiles from the standard normal distribution (which has a mean $\\mu=0$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma=1$). This type of QQ-plots against the normal distribution are known as QQ-normal plots. If the variable is normally distributed, then a linear relationship will be observed.\n\nTo construct a QQ-plot we can use the function `qq_plot` from the `pubh` package. QQ-plots can be used even for relatively small samples.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig8\n#| fig-cap: \"QQ-plot of breast-milk intake against the normal distribution.\"\nkfm %>%\n  qq_plot(~ dl.milk) \n```\n\nWe can use `plots` to display more than one plot in a grid:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig9\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of breast-milk intake in infants. (a) Density plot. (b) QQ-plot against the normal distribution.\"\np1 = kfm %>%\n  gf_dens(~ dl.milk, size = 1) %>%\n  axis_labs()\n\np2 = kfm %>%\n  qq_plot(~ dl.milk) %>%\n  axis_labs()\n\nplots(p1, p2, n_columns = 2, tags = \"a\")\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  The argument `n_columns = 2` is used to display the two plots on the same row. By default `n_columns = 1`.\n2.  With `tags = \"a\"` we are using lower case auto caption.\n3.  We need to include axis_labs when we display more than one plot as `ggormula` does not longer recognise the original label of the variable.\n:::\n\nA variable that is positive-skewed is $J$-shaped in a QQ-plot.\n\n> **Exercise:** Using a QQ-plot, determine if SBP from normal subjects (no CHD event) in the `WCGS` dataset follows a normal distribution.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig10\n#| fig-cap: \"QQ-plot of systolic blood pressure (SBP) against the normal distribution, for subjects who did not present a coronary heart disease event in the WCGS dataset.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  filter(chd == \"No CHD\") %>%\n  copy_labels(wcgs) %>%\n  qq_plot(~ sbp)\n```\n\n> **Answer:** The QQ-plots shows that the distribution of SBP in control subjects is positive skewed.\n\n## Associations between continuous variables\n\n### Scatter plots\n\nWe use scatter plots to look at the relationship between two continuous variables. By default, the dependent variable (response) is plotted on the $y$ axis while the independent variable (explanatory) is plotted on the $x$ axis.\n\nFrom the `kfm` dataset, let's see if there is a relationship between the weight of the mother and the breast-milk intake of the child.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig11\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake in infants.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, pch = 16, \n           color = ~ sex, size = 1.5)\n```\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe `pch` argument in `gf_point` can be used to specify the symbol to plot the data. The default is `pch = 16` which uses filled circles.\n:::\n\n@fig-fig12 shows the most common symbols used in `R`. Symbols are defined with the option `pch`. For example, `pch = 17` would use filled triangles. You can also use symbols from the keyboard, for example `pch = \"+\"`, `pch = \"o\"`, `pch = \"@\"`, etc. When we have an enormous sample size, and we want to use a tiny symbol, we can type: `pch = \".\"`, alternatively, play with the option `size`.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig12\n#| fig-cap: \"Common symbols used in `R`.\"\n#| echo: false\ngenerateRPointShapes<-function(){\n  oldPar<-par()\n  par(font=2, mar=c(0.5,0,0,0))\n  y=rev(c(rep(1,6),rep(2,5), rep(3,5), rep(4,5), rep(5,5)))\n  x=c(rep(1:5,5),6)\n  plot(x, y, pch = 0:25, cex=1.5, ylim=c(1,5.5), xlim=c(1,6.5), \n       axes=FALSE, xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", bg=\"blue\")\n  text(x, y, labels=0:25, pos=3)\n  par(mar=oldPar$mar,font=oldPar$font )\n}\ngenerateRPointShapes()\n```\n\nThe advantage of `ggplot2` and `ggformula` is that plots can be extended and used for multivariate graphical analysis. For example, we could add a line representing a linear fit:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig13\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake in infants.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight) %>%\n  gf_lm(interval = \"confidence\", col = \"indianred\", \n        fill = \"indianred\")\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  We use `gf_lm` to fit a linear model (`lm`) and `gf_smooth` to show the trend (loess fit).\n2.  The default is to not show a band (`interval = \"none\"`). In the current example, we are showing the confidence intervals around the predicted fitted values.\n:::\n\nWe can plot, on the same panel, the relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig14\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, \n           pch = ~ sex, col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_lm(col = ~ sex)\n```\n\nThe package `ggsci` contains different palettes of colours for the most important journals (including *Nature*, *Science*, *NEJM*, etc.). Some examples:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig15\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex. Plot uses palette of colours favoured by JAMA.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, \n           pch = ~ sex, col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_lm(col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_jama()) \n```\n\nWe already learnt how to construct *conditional* plots, i.e., to display plots in different panels *given* a particular condition (using the `|` symbol).\n\n> **Exercise:** Construct a plot showing the relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex using one panel for each sex. Include a linear fit to your plot with corresponding bands of confidence intervals.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig16\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight|sex, pch = 20) %>%\n  gf_lm(interval = \"confidence\", col = \"indianred\", \n        fill = \"indianred\")\n```\n\n### Scatter plot matrix (supplementary, optional sub-section)\n\nWhen we are working with more than two continuous variables and we want to look at potential correlations between them, we can generate a single plot, with all two-variable combinations displayed in different panels. This kind of plot is known as a scatter plot matrix and we can construct them with `ggpairs` from the package `GGally`.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n`GGally` has two other functions that can also construct a scatter plot matrix: `ggduo` and `ggscatmat`; `ggapairs` is however, more flexible.\n:::\n\nFor example, we could be interested in looking at the relationship between pollution, expressed in ozone concentration, in relation with other environmental variables. We load the dataset:\n\n```{r}\ndata(airquality)\nairquality <- na.omit(airquality)\nnames(airquality)\n```\n\nNext, we define the variable `Month` as a factor.\n\n```{r}\nmes = c(\"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\")\nairquality = airquality %>%\n  mutate(\n    Month = factor(Month, labels = mes)\n    )\n```\n\nFunction `ggpairs` does not work well with labelled datasets so we are going to generate a vector with the labels of the variables:\n\n```{r}\nair = c(\"Temperature (F)\", \"Wind (mph)\",\n         \"Radiation (A)\", \"Ozone (ppb)\")\n```\n\nIn our first scatter plot matrix, we are going to show also the loess trend:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig17\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between pollution (ozone) and some environmental variables. Curves show loess trend.\"\n#| message: false\nairquality %>%\n  ggpairs(\n    columns = 4:1,\n    lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"smooth_loess\", alpha = 0.5,\n                                   shape = 20, size = 0.9,\n                                   color = \"cadetblue\")),\n    columnLabels = air\n    )\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  With option `columns` we select which columns of the dataset we want to plot. The default (if omitted) is to plot all.\n2.  We selected columns from 4 to 1 because we want for `Ozone` to be displayed on the $y$-axis.\n3.  We use option `lower` to indicate what we want to plot on the *lower* diagonal.\n4.  We add a loess trend with `smooth_loess`. For a linear model, we would use `smooth`.\n5.  The diagonal shows the distributions of each variable. For continuous variables, the diagonal displays density plots and for categorical variables shows bar charts.\n6.  To understand the plot, focus on the bottom row. In panels of the bottom row, ozone is plotted on the $y$-axis; first against temperature, next against wind and finally, against solar radiation.\n:::\n\nThe `airquality` dataset includes a categorical variable, `Month` that we can use to stratify continuous variables.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig18\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between pollution (ozone) and some environmental variables by month.\"\nairquality %>%\n  ggpairs(\n    columns = 4:1, \n    mapping = aes(color = Month, alpha = 0.8),\n    lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"points\",\n                                   shape = 20, size = 1)),\n    upper = list(continuous = wrap(\"cor\", size = 2)),\n    columnLabels = air\n    )\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n1.  We use `mapping`, a function from `ggplot2` to stratify by `Month`. Please notice that `ggplot2` does not uses formulas, hence the lack of the tilde (`~`).\n2.  We used option `\"points\"` as to display only symbols with no added fit.\n3.  If we use `\"smooth\"` or `\"smooth_loess\"` we would have added a fit for each month making the plot harder to interpret.\n4.  We included the option `upper` only to decrease the size of the font to `size = 2`, so the information of the correlations fit well within the panels.\n:::\n\nIf our data is labelled, we need to remove the labels for `ggpair` to work. As usual, as long as we don't assign the commands of the pipe-workflow to a variable (data frame) then our alterations will not be stored and will have only a local effect.\n\nFor example, let's say we would like to look at relationships within the `kfm` dataset. In the following code, we remove the labels and we change the reference level of sex, just to display boys in blue and girls in pink.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig19\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between breast-milk intake (dl/day) and other variables from the `kfm` dataset.\"\nkfm %>%\n  remove_all_labels() %>%\n  mutate(\n    sex = relevel(sex, ref = \"Girl\")\n  ) %>%\n  ggpairs(\n    columns = c(4:7, 2),\n    mapping = aes(color = sex, alpha = 0.8),\n    lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"points\",\n                                   shape = 20, size = 1)),\n    upper = list(continuous = wrap(\"cor\", size = 3)),\n    columnLabels = c(\n      \"Child weight\",\n      \"Milk-substitute\",\n      \"Maternal weight\",\n      \"Maternal height\",\n      \"Breast-milk\"\n      )\n    )\n```\n\n### Correlation plots\n\nAn alternative to scatter-plot matrices are correlation plots:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig20\n#| fig-cap: \"Correlation plot of continuous varialbes from the `airquality` dataset.\"\n#| warning: false\nairquality %>% \n  select(- c(Month, Day)) %>% \n  correlation(rename = air, method = \"spearman\") %>% \n  summary() %>% plot(show_data = \"points\") %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_lucid())\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n1.  Correlation plots have the disadvantage of not showing the actual relationship between the variables, nor to their distributions but only a visual representation of the correlation matrix.\n2.  Correlation is covered in the regression section.\n:::\n\n### Line charts\n\nSometimes, we don't want to fit a trend or a linear model, but to actually connect all observations. With `gf_path` we connect observations in the order in which they appear in the data, whereas with `gf_line` we connect them in the order of the variable on the $x$-axis.\n\nPerhaps, the best example when we want to connect observations is when we are working with time series data.\n\nDownload the file *fluraw.csv* from Moodle, save it on your *data* directory and load it to the session.\n\n```{r}\nflu = read_csv(\"data/fluraw.csv\")\nhead(flu)\n```\n\n```{r}\nflu = flu %>%\n  var_labels(\n    week = \"Date\"\n  ) %>%\n  as.data.frame()\n```\n\nThe data frame is recorded in what is known as *wide* format. We will use the function `pivot_longer` from `dplyr` to transform it to *long* format.\n\n```{r}\nflu_melt = flu %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !week,\n    names_to = \"agegrp\",\n    values_to = \"cases\"\n  )\n\nflu_melt %>% head()\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  We select the columns that we want to rearrange in `cols`. With `!week`, we are making a negative selection (read as *not week*).\n2.  The name of the new categorical variable is gen to `names_to`. The names of the columns are used as levels of the variable.\n3.  The actual values are stored in another variable, which name can be given at `values_to`.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig21\n#| fig-cap: \"Dynamics of reported influenza cases by age group, in the 1957 pandemic in England and Wales.\"\nflu_melt %>%\n  gf_line(cases ~ week, col = ~ agegrp, size = 0.8) %>%\n  gf_labs(col = \"Age group\") %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_npg()) \n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  With option `size` we can modify the width of the lines.\n2.  In this example, instead of labelling the data, I specified the names of the axis as part of the plot.\n3.  The last line of code is optional and it uses the palette of colours preferred by *Nature* (*Nature Publishing Group*).\n:::\n\n### Kaplan-Meier plots\n\nStep plots are a variation of line charts in which the lines connect observations by steps instead of direct lines. The best example of step plots are those used in survival analysis as proposed by Kaplan and Meier.\n\nFor our example, we will use data about survival in patients with advanced lung cancer. We load the `survival` package to generate the information that we need to make a Kaplan-Meier plot. After loading the dataset, we transform variable `sex` to a factor.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\nFor this tutorial, we are not interested in the modelling, only on constructing and interpreting the plot.\n:::\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(survival)\ndata(cancer, package = \"survival\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nlung = cancer %>%\n  mutate(\n    Sex = factor(sex, labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))\n  )\n```\n\nNext, we estimate survival stratified by sex:\n\n```{r}\nsurv_fit = survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ Sex, data = lung)\nsurv_fit\n```\n\nWe can use `autoplot` to construct the Kaplan-Meier plot:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig22\n#| fig-cap: \"Kaplan-Meir plot for survival in patients with advanced lung cancer.\"\nautoplot(surv_fit) %>%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Time (days)\", y = \"Survival\")\n```\n\n## Comparing groups\n\nMany times, we are interested in comparing groups, for example:\n\n-   treatment vs control\n-   cases vs control\n-   drug A vs drug B\n-   females vs males\n\nIn these examples, the groups or cohorts represent the *explanatory* (exposure) variable. If the outcome is continuous, then we are interested in comparing distributions and/or a measure of central tendency.\n\n### Box plots\n\nWhen we are comparing continuous variables, between two or more groups, box plots are the best option, particularly if the number of observations in the groups is relatively large ($\\geq$ 30).\n\nWe are going to use the function `box_plot` from the `pubh` package to construct box plots.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig23\n#| fig-cap: \"Box plots of blood cholesterol by coronary heart disease (CHD) event from the WCGS dataset.\"\n#| warning: false\nwcgs %>%\n  box_plot(chol ~ chd)\n```\n\nIn the previous figure the presence of an outlier is clear. If we would like to remove that outlier, we would need to declare that in the report. For demonstration purposes, if we do not want to show the outlier in the plot, we have the option to `filter` the data as shown in the following code:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig24\n#| fig-cap: \"Box plots of blood cholesterol by coronary heart disease (CHD) event from the WCGS dataset. A single outlier from the CHD group with a cholesterol concentration of 675 mg/dl is not shown for group comparison purposes.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  filter(chol < 500) %>%\n  copy_labels(wcgs) %>%\n  box_plot(chol ~ chd, fill = \"thistle3\", alpha = 0.7)\n```\n\n### Significant lines (supplementary, optional sub-section)\n\n> **Exercise:** Construct a plot comparing the distributions of breast-milk intake (`dl.milk`) by sex from the `kfm` data set.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig25\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  box_plot(dl.milk ~ sex)\n```\n\nWe can use box plots to show the results of our analysis. It happens that there is a significant difference in the mean value of breast-milk intake between boys and girls (we do not need to worry how to test this, yet). In our final report, if we would like to include a figure to show this difference, we can *draw* a line over the groups that we are comparing and *type* an asterisk to indicate the difference. To do that, we can use `gf_star` from the `pubh` package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig26\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake by sex ($^*p$ = 0.035, $t$-test).\"\nkfm %>%\n  box_plot(dl.milk ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_star(x1 = 1, y1 = 10.9, x2 = 2, y2 = 11, y3 = 11.2)\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  By default, the centre of the boxes is drawn over integer numbers in the $x$-axis, starting with one.\n2.  We are providing points of reference to draw the line with `gf_star`.\n3.  `gf_star` draws a horizontal line from coordinate $(x_1, y_2)$ to coordinate $(x_2, y_2)$. Draws vertical lines below the horizontal line, towards data, from $(x_1, y_2)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$ and from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_2, y_1)$. Finally, adds text above the horizontal line, at the mid point between $x_1$ and $x_2$, at height $y_3$.\n:::\n\nIt is possible to show the actual $p$-value in the plot. We can also, keep adding *layers* to the plot; for example, we can show all the observations, which we will *jitter* on the $x$-axis, so they can be better appreciated:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig27\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  box_plot(dl.milk ~ sex, alpha = 0.5) %>%\n  gf_jitter(dl.milk ~ sex, width = 0.1, height = 0, \n            alpha = 0.8, pch = 20, size = 0.6) %>%\n  gf_star(1, 10.9, 2, 11, 11.4, \n          legend = 'p = 0.035', size = 3) \n```\n\nPackage `ggpubr` includes a function, `stat_compare_means` that automatically calculates coordinates to show the results of the hypothesis testing. In that sense, it's easier to use than `gf_star` but it's less flexible.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n`ggpubr` does not work with formulas, instead, shares the same syntax of `ggplot2` so layers are added with `+` instead of `%>%`.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig28\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  box_plot(dl.milk ~ sex, alpha = 0.5) %>%\n  gf_jitter(dl.milk ~ sex, width = 0.1, height = 0, \n            alpha = 0.8, pch = 20, size = 0.6) +\n  stat_compare_means(comparisons = list(c(1, 2)), \n                     method = 't.test')\n```\n\n### Strip charts\n\nWhen we want to compare groups and the number of observations is relatively small ($n$ \\< 30) box plots are not good. It is better to show all data in a variation of a scatter plot known as strip plot or strip chart.\n\nWe will use the data `energy` from the `ISwR` package about the energy expenditure of lean and obese women.\n\n```{r}\ndata(energy, package = \"ISwR\")\nhead(energy)\n```\n\n```{r}\nenergy = energy %>%\n  var_labels(\n    expend = \"Energy expenditure (MJ)\",\n    stature = \"Stature\"\n  )\n\nwrite_rds(energy, \"data/energy.rds\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig29\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of energy between obese and lean women.\"\nenergy %>%\n  gf_jitter(expend ~ stature, width = 0.1, \n            height = 0)\n```\n\nIt is easier to compare the groups if we include error bars showing the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the mean. To do that, we can use the function `strip_error` from the `pubh` package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig30\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of energy expenditure between lean and obese women. Error bars represent bootstrap 95% CI.\"\nenergy %>%\n  strip_error(expend ~ stature, size = 2)\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIn `strip_error`, the argument `size` refers to the size of the symbols used to plot the individual observations.\n:::\n\nThe rationale to add a significant line is the same as for box plots.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig31\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of energy expenditure between lean and obese women. Error bars represent 95% bootstrap CI ($^*p$ = 0.001, $t$-test).\"\nenergy %>%\n  strip_error(expend ~ stature, size = 2) %>%\n  gf_star(1, 13.3, 2, 13.4, 13.5)\n```\n\nWe can also construct strip plots with error bars, by groups.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig32\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of birth weight of babies born from mothers with different smoking status by race. Error bars represent 95% bootstrap CI.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  strip_error(bwt ~ smoke, pch = ~ Race, col = ~ Race) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_jama()) \n```\n\n### Violin plots (supplementary, optional sub-section)\n\nViolin plots combine ideas from both density plots and box plots. They show density distributions and can incorporate other elements, like strip charts.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig33\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake distributions by sex.\"\nkfm %>%\n  gf_violin(dl.milk ~ sex, fill = ~ sex, alpha = 0.3) %>%\n  gf_jitter(dl.milk ~ sex, width = 0.1, height = 0)\n```\n\nFor larger datasets, we can add summary of statistics using error bars indicating the mean and 95% CI around mean values.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig34\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by coronary heart disease event, stratified by behaviour pattern.\"\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_violin(sbp ~ chd, fill = ~ beh_pat, alpha = 0.3) %>%\n  gf_summary(fun.data = \"mean_cl_boot\", \n             geom = 'pointrange', fatten = 1,\n             position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) \n```\n\n### Bar charts\n\nBar charts or bar plots are used, most of the time, to display information from a table graphically. Therefore, for publications are not the best option as a table uses less space and contains better information.\n\nFor example, we can use `sjplot` from the `sjPlot` package to graphically compare the frequency distributions of babies with low birth weights by race.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig35\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of lower birth weights by race.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  select(race, low) %>%\n  sjplot(show.values = FALSE, show.prc = FALSE)\n```\n\nSame plot but using `gf_counts` from `ggformula`:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig36\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of lower birth weights by race.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_counts(~ race, fill = ~ low, position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.6) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_lancet())\n```\n\nWe had already shown the use of box plots. In box plots, we are comparing medians and distributions instead of means. It is because of that limitation that some authors favour the use of bar charts in which the height of the bars represent mean values for each group and error bars are included to show dispersion. For *inferential statistics* we would show either standard errors or 95% CIs.\n\nIn the `pubh` package there is a function that automatically does that.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig37\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of breast-milk intake between boys and girls. Bar heights are mean values and error bars represent 95% CIs (bootstrap).\"\nkfm %>%\n  bar_error(dl.milk ~ sex) \n```\n\nAs it was the case with strip plots, we can also construct bar plots stratified by a second factor:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig38\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of birth weights of babies born from mothers with different smoking status, stratified by race. Height of bars represent mean birth weight values for each group and error bars, 95% CI around those mean values.\"\nbirthwt %>%\n  bar_error(bwt ~ smoke|Race, fill = 'plum3')\n```\n\nIt is also possible to play with `col` and `fill` and to add more layers, like `gf_star`.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fig39\n#| fig-cap: \"Comparison of birth weights of babies born from mothers with different smoking status, stratified by race. Height of bars represent mean birth weight values for each group and error bars, 95% CI around those mean values. (a) Example showing the effect of col by group. (b) Example showing the effect of fill by group ($^*p$ < 0.05).\"\np1 = birthwt %>%\n  bar_error(bwt ~ smoke, col = ~ Race, \n            fill = 'white', title = \"(a)\") %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_lancet()) %>%\n  axis_labs()\n\np2 = birthwt %>%\n  bar_error(bwt ~ smoke, fill = ~ Race, \n            title = \"(b)\") %>%\n  axis_labs() %>% \n  gf_refine(scale_fill_jama()) %>%\n  gf_star(x1=0.8, x2=1.2, y1=3800, y2=3900, y3=3950)\n\nautoplot(list(p1, p2))\n```\n\n## Exporting figures\n\nWhen you are working in your `RMarkdown` documents, there is no need to export figures, and everything is done automatically.\n\nWhen you run your commands interactively, plots are shown in the *Plots* tab. The easiest way to export them is to click on `Export` and select `Save as PDF`. PDF figures can be inserted in Word, Power Point, Keynote, Pages, etc. The plot will be saved as shown on your viewer, not always the best idea. Word and Power Point work better with `.png` figures.\n\n### Postscript figures\n\nWe have more control if we export the file using the function `pdf` than exporting them with the viewer. When we use this option, the instruction could be part of our script file. We need three sections of code to export a figure this way:\n\n1.  The first section creates the file and defines the size of the plot. The units are in inches.\n2.  The second section makes the plot.\n3.  The third section is used to close the device. Is a way to tell the system that we have finished the plot.\n\n```{r}\n#| results: hide\npdf(\"figures/fig6.pdf\", height = 4, width = 5.3, pointsize = 9)\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt|smoke, fill = ~ race, alpha=0.3)\ndev.off()\n```\n\nFor publications, is more common that publishers will ask for a `.eps` file (encapsulated postscript). The command is very similar.\n\n```{r}\n#| results: hide\npostscript(\"figures/fig15.eps\", height = 4, width = 5.3, \n           pointsize = 9, horizontal = FALSE)\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, pch = ~ sex, col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_lm(col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_jama())\ndev.off()\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":6,"fig-height":4,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":true,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc-depth":3,"output-file":"graphical.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
