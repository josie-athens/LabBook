There are more graphic packages that allow better graphics, one of them is `ggplot2` whose syntax is relatively complex. We will be using the package `ggformula` which simplifies syntax for constructing plots with `ggplot2` using formulas as part of its syntax. The package is loaded in the system when you load the `pubh` package.\n\nThere are different reasons to make a plot. For manuscripts and reports, plots in black and white (B&W) are sometimes preferred (as figures in colour have an extra cost). However, if you want to show your plots in a presentation or a poster, a colour would be more appropriate.\n\n**For manuscripts**\n\n1.  Include figure legends (captions).\n2.  The *main* title is not included in the plot but as part of the description in the legend.\n3.  Use B&W plots, you can use any variation of grey.\n4.  Export the plot as a `.eps` or `.pdf` file (see last section).\n\n**For reports, including assignments**\n\n1.  Include figure legends (captions).\n2.  The *main* title is not included in the plot but as part of the description in the legend.\n3.  You can play with colours, but be smart, e.g., avoid bright colours.\n\n**For presentations**\n\n1.  Do not include long legends.\n2.  Use a medium to large font so audience can read your legends.\n3.  Include a main title for the plot.\n4.  Use colours!\n5.  Include extra information to explain the plot, or make sure that you explain well your plot in your presentation.\n6.  Export the plot as a `.pdf` or `.png` file (see last section).\n\nWe will use the `wcgs` dataset as an example of a relatively large data, the `kfm` dataset as an example of a relatively small data and the `birthwt` as an example of medium size data.\n\nFirst we load datasets that we have saved in previous labs:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs = read_rds('data/wcgs.rds')\nkfm = read_rds('data/kfm.rds')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we load the `birthwt` dataset from the `MASS` package, generate factors and assign labels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(birthwt, package = \"MASS\")\nbirthwt = as_tibble(birthwt)\nbirthwt = birthwt %>%\n  mutate(\n    low = factor(low, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n    lwt = lwt * 0.4536,\n    smoke = factor(smoke, labels = c(\"Non-smoker\", \"Smoker\")),\n    Race = factor(race > 1, labels = c(\"White\", \"Non-white\")),\n    race = factor(race, labels = c(\"White\", \"African-American\", \"Other\")),\n    ht = factor(ht, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n    ui = factor(ui, labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n  ) %>%\n  var_labels(\n    low = \"Birth weight less than 2.5 kg\",\n    age = \"Mother's age (years)\",\n    lwt = \"Mother's weight (kg)\",\n    bwt = 'Birth weight (g)',\n    smoke = 'Smoking status',\n    race = \"Mother's race\",\n    ptl = \"Premature labours\",\n    ht = \"Hypertension\",\n    ui = \"Uterine irritability\",\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(birthwt, \"data/birthwt.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Extensions and links\n\nFor this lab, we are going to load some packages that extend functions from `ggplot2`.\n\n-   Functions in `ggsci` are really optional as they provide palettes used in journals.\n-   Functions in `GGaly` are just for special cases, like scatter plot matrices.\n-   Functions in `ggpubr` are intended for publication purposes.\n-   Functions in `plotly` allow to interact with the plots.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n**External links**\n\n- More information on `ggformula`, including tutorials, can be found [here](https://projectmosaic.github.io/ggformula/index.html).\n- Examples for `ggpubr` can be found [here](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/).\n- Examples for `GGally` can be found [here](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/index.html).\n- Examples about axis scales and transformations can be found [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-axis-scales-and-transformations).\n:::\n\n## Distributions\n\nAs part of the descriptive analysis, it is important to understand the distribution of continuous outcomes. For relatively large datasets, histograms and density plots are appropriate.\n\n### Histograms\n\nWe use histograms to look at the distribution of continuous variables. Histograms make most sense for relatively large data ($\\geq$ 100 observations). The `ggformula` package uses *formulas*; in the case of histograms, there is no left-hand side (as it was the case of `estat`). For example, for plotting the histogram of systolic blood pressure we type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_histogram( ~ sbp, col = \"black\", fill = \"pink\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig1-1.png){#fig-fig1 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nThe bars are not at the centre of the plot, that means we have cases (very few of them) with high values of cholesterol. In other words, the distribution is clearly skewed to the right (i.e., with a positive skew).\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  At the start of the code, the first two lines (hidden on the final document) are:\n  - `#| label: fig-fig1`\n  - `#| fig-cap: \"Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.\"`\n2.  The label (name) of the chunk is: `fig-fig1`. When the label starts with `fig-`, the figure is automatically numbered. To refer to @fig-fig1 in the document we type: `@fig-fig1`.\n3.  The option `col` refers to the colour of the lines defining the bars; the option `fill` refers to the colour inside the bars.\n4.  You can look at the list of colours available by typing `colors()` in the *Console* panel.\n:::\n\nIn our first plot, the $y$-axis shows the frequency (counts), we may want to show the density (proportion) instead. Densities are preferred when comparing two or more distributions. To choose density we use `gf_dhistogram`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_dhistogram(~ sbp, col = \"black\", fill = \"plum3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig2-1.png){#fig-fig2 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can compare groups using the `|` symbol, which can be understood as *given* or *by*:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs %>%\n  gf_dhistogram(~ sbp|chd, col = \"black\", fill = \"slategray3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by coronary heart disease (CHD) event for the WCGS dataset.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig3-1.png){#fig-fig3 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Density plots\n\nAn alternative to histograms is density plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_dens(~ bwt, col = \"cadetblue\", lwd = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of birth weight.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig4-1.png){#fig-fig4 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can use superimposed density plots to compare distributions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt, fill = ~ smoke, alpha = 0.3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of birth weight distributions by mother's smoking status.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig5-1.png){#fig-fig5 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  In the previous code, instead of displaying the distributions in two different panels (*faceting*) as we did with histograms, we are displaying them in the same panel but super-imposed.\n2.  By using the option `fill = ~ smoke`, we are telling `R` to select filling colours according to levels in the variable `smoke`.\n3.  With `alpha` we reduce the opacity, thus increase the transparency.\n4.  With `gf_dens` we plot only the contour whereas with `gf_density` the area under the curve is filled.\n:::\n\nIf you use the template from the `pubh` package, legends are placed on *top* of the plot. To specify a different location, we can use the argument `legend.position` in `gf_theme`. With `legend.position` we can either specify a side of the plot (e.g. `\"right\"`) or give relative coordinates. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt|smoke, fill = ~ race, alpha=0.3) %>%\n  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.12, 0.85))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of birth weight distributions by smoking status of the mother and race of the mother.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig6-1.png){#fig-fig6 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nCoordinates are given as `c(x, y)`, where values of `x` and `y` go from 0 to 1 and represent a proportion in the corresponding axis.\n:::\n\nTo help on the interpretation of histograms, we can impose a *density* plot derived from a population with the same mean and standard deviation of the variable of interest. To make this plot, we can use the function `hist_norm` from the `pubh` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs %>%\n  hist_norm(~ sbp, bins = 30) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the WCGS dataset. The black curve represents a density plot from a normal distribution.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig7-1.png){#fig-fig7 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### QQ-plots\n\nThe best way to determine if a continuous variable is normally distributed or not is with quantile-quantile plots (QQ-plots). We plot the quantiles of our variable of interest against quantiles from the standard normal distribution (which has a mean $\\mu=0$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma=1$). This type of QQ-plots against the normal distribution are known as QQ-normal plots. If the variable is normally distributed, then a linear relationship will be observed.\n\nTo construct a QQ-plot we can use the function `qq_plot` from the `pubh` package. QQ-plots can be used even for relatively small samples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkfm %>%\n  qq_plot(~ dl.milk) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![QQ-plot of breast-milk intake against the normal distribution.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig8-1.png){#fig-fig8 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can use `plots` to display more than one plot in a grid:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 = kfm %>%\n  gf_dens(~ dl.milk, size = 1) %>%\n  axis_labs()\n\np2 = kfm %>%\n  qq_plot(~ dl.milk) %>%\n  axis_labs()\n\nplots(p1, p2, n_columns = 2, tags = \"a\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of breast-milk intake in infants. (a) Density plot. (b) QQ-plot against the normal distribution.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig9-1.png){#fig-fig9 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.  The argument `n_columns = 2` is used to display the two plots on the same row. By default `n_columns = 1`.\n2.  With `tags = \"a\"` we are using lower case auto caption.\n3.  We need to include axis_labs when we display more than one plot as `ggormula` does not longer recognise the original label of the variable.\n:::\n\nA variable that is positive-skewed is $J$-shaped in a QQ-plot.\n\n> **Exercise:** Using a QQ-plot, determine if SBP from normal subjects (no CHD event) in the `WCGS` dataset follows a normal distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwcgs %>%\n  filter(chd == \"No CHD\") %>%\n  copy_labels(wcgs) %>%\n  qq_plot(~ sbp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![QQ-plot of systolic blood pressure (SBP) against the normal distribution, for subjects who did not present a coronary heart disease event in the WCGS dataset.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig10-1.png){#fig-fig10 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> **Answer:** The QQ-plots shows that the distribution of SBP in control subjects is positive skewed.\n\n## Associations between continuous variables\n\n### Scatter plots\n\nWe use scatter plots to look at the relationship between two continuous variables. By default, the dependent variable (response) is plotted on the $y$ axis while the independent variable (explanatory) is plotted on the $x$ axis.\n\nFrom the `kfm` dataset, let's see if there is a relationship between the weight of the mother and the breast-milk intake of the child.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, pch = 16, \n           color = ~ sex, size = 1.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake in infants.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig11-1.png){#fig-fig11 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe `pch` argument in `gf_point` can be used to specify the symbol to plot the data. The default is `pch = 16` which uses filled circles.\n:::\n\n@fig-fig12 shows the most common symbols used in `R`. Symbols are defined with the option `pch`. For example, `pch = 17` would use filled triangles. You can also use symbols from the keyboard, for example `pch = \"+\"`, `pch = \"o\"`, `pch = \"@\"`, etc. When we have an enormous sample size, and we want to use a tiny symbol, we can type: `pch = \".\"`, alternatively, play with the option `size`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Common symbols used in `R`.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig12-1.png){#fig-fig12 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe advantage of `ggplot2` and `ggformula` is that plots can be extended and used for multivariate graphical analysis. For example, we could add a line representing a linear fit:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight) %>%\n  gf_lm(interval = \"confidence\", col = \"indianred\", \n        fill = \"indianred\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake in infants.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig13-1.png){#fig-fig13 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1.

In the current example, we are showing the confidence intervals around the predicted fitted values.\n:::\n\nWe can plot, on the same panel, the relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, \n           pch = ~ sex, col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_lm(col = ~ sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between maternal weight and breast-milk intake by sex.](graphical_files/figure-html/fig-fig14-1.png){#fig-fig14 width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe package `ggsci` contains different palettes of colours for the most important journals (including *Nature*, *Science*, *NEJM*, etc.).

The easiest way to export them is to click on `Export` and select `Save as PDF`. PDF figures can be inserted in Word, Power Point, Keynote, Pages, etc. The plot will be saved as shown on your viewer, not always the best idea. Word and Power Point work better with `.png` figures.\n\n### Postscript figures\n\nWe have more control if we export the file using the function `pdf` than exporting them with the viewer. When we use this option, the instruction could be part of our script file. We need three sections of code to export a figure this way:\n\n1.  The first section creates the file and defines the size of the plot. The units are in inches.\n2.  The second section makes the plot.\n3.  The third section is used to close the device. Is a way to tell the system that we have finished the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npdf(\"figures/fig6.pdf\", height = 4, width = 5.3, pointsize = 9)\nbirthwt %>%\n  gf_density(~ bwt|smoke, fill = ~ race, alpha=0.3)\ndev.off()\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor publications, is more common that publishers will ask for a `.eps` file (encapsulated postscript). The command is very similar.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npostscript(\"figures/fig15.eps\", height = 4, width = 5.3, \n           pointsize = 9, horizontal = FALSE)\nkfm %>%\n  gf_point(dl.milk ~ mat.weight, pch = ~ sex, col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_lm(col = ~ sex) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_jama())\ndev.off()\n```\n:::\n",
